# ðŸŽ‰ Getting started

- Execute `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Setup DOTENV

- Make sure to include a `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` variable containing the base64 encoded service account json file. For reference, see `.env.sample`.

## Creating a script
- Create a new file in the `src/scripts` directory.
- Make sure to set the script function as the `default export`.
- See `src/scripts/hello_world.ts` for an example.

## Running a script

  ```bash
  npm run scripts <script-name-1> <script-name-2> ...
  ```

  ```bash
  npm run scripts hello_world hello_world
  ```
